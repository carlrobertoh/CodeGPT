## About The Project

ProxyAI is an AI-powered code assistant designed to help you with various programming activities. It is a great alternative to GitHub Copilot, AI Assistant, Codiumate, or any other extension on the JetBrains marketplace.

We equip you with the latest models, advanced tools, and on-premise solutions that are designed to significantly enhance your developer experience.

Access top-tier language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Mistral, and others, or opt for a self-hosted model for a full offline experience.

## Core Features

ProxyAI offers a wide range of features to enhance your development experience:

### Chat

- **Auto Apply:** Stream AI-suggested code changes directly into your editor. Preview modifications in diff view and approve or reject them with a single click.

- **Use images:** Chat with your images. Upload manually or let ProxyAI auto-detect your screenshots. 

- **Reference your files and folders:** Quickly access and reference your project files and folders for context-aware coding assistance.

- **Reference web docs:** Quickly reference web docs in your chat session, such as API guides, library manuals, and more. 

- **Reference git history:** Quickly reference commit logs and changes in your chat session 

- **Search the web:** Connect your favourite LLM to the web. ProxyAI will search for the most relevant information to answer your questions. 

- **Customize your assistant:** Choose between multiple different personas for your specific needs, whether you're looking to learn, write or proofread.

### Code


- **Code Assistant <sup><small>(new)</small></sup>:** Get multi-line edits based on your recent activity, open files and previous chat interactions.

- **Autocomplete your code:** Receive single-line or whole-function autocomplete suggestions as you type.

- **Edit code in natural language:** Highlight the code you want to modify, describe the desired changes, and watch ProxyAI work its magic.

- **Get name suggestions:** Get context-aware naming suggestions for methods, variables, and more.
